My name is Matthew Meade (pronounced 'meed' - silent 'e'), this is the source repository for my personal website. I currently use my personal website for marketing myself and my abilities, exhibiting my portfolio, hosting my own blog, and to demonstrate some of my technical knowledge.

The site is currently under development, but will feature the following (non-exhaustive) list technologies:
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- SQL
- C#
- ASP.NET
- Ghost (open-source blogging platform)
